<b>Main Site:</b> https://www.telelbirds.com - HATCHING SOON!

<b>Features:</b>

* <b>Simple, easy to use.</b>  Entering glucose data should be faster than finding a pen and paper and writing down the number.  Fields have pre-set values where it makes sense (such as the date, time, and category based on time of day).
* <b>Send notifications via email/sms.</b>  Email it to your doctor before your visit, no more carrying log books (and you're saving trees)!  Can be sent as a CSV or PDF attachment.
* <b>Reporting.</b>  Simple reports to see how you're doing.  Highlight how many times you have lows and highs. Show averages by day and category using nice-looking charts and graphs.
* <b>Data filtering.</b>  Advanced filtering: filter by glucose range, date range, category, tag, and notes.
* <b>Tagging.</b>  An optional tag field to help further organize and make sense of your data. For example, it might be useful to add tags to a record such as: exercise, sick, insulin, fasting, etc.
* <b>Expenditure estimation.</b>  Estimate expenditures based on data from the last 3 months.
* <b>Import data from CSV.</b> Import existing data from other software/systems.
